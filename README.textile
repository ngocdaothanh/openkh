OpenKH is Open + Know-How. It aims to become "Drupal on Rails" with one
difference: OPEN
* There are only 2 types of users: normal user and admin (e.g no moderator).
* Normal users can do everything with minimum restriction from the admins, thus
OpenKH is perfect for building open community sites (e.g. sites where users are
able to collaborate to create blikis, QAs, books).
