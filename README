OpenKH is Open + Know-How. It is just "Drupal on Rails" with one difference
in philosophy: OPEN
* There are only 2 types of users: normal user and admin (e.g no moderator).
* Basically normal users can do everything with minimum restriction from the
admins, perfect for building open knowledge sites (e.g. sites where users are
able to openly collaborate to create books, blikis, QAs).

To install read INSTALL, to create modules or themes read doc directory.

See "doc" directory for some documentation. To build the guides:
* Install source-highlighter (http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/source-highlight.html)
* Install the mizuho gem (http://github.com/FooBarWidget/mizuho/tree/master)
* Run `rake guides` from the railties directory
