See themes directory for samples.

How a theme works? Easy. Files (e.g. views, CSS, JavaScript, images) you put in
the active theme directory will overwrite files at other places.

To create a theme, you must be familliar with at least Rails, HAML (for views),
SASS (for CSS).

== Loading and effective order

Just create .sass files and they will be automatically loaded in alphanumeric
order. Remember to prefix them with your module name to avoid naming conflict.

File loading order: modules_core -> modules -> theme

CSS effective order: theme -> modules -> modules_core

== Notes

For the CAPTCHA to work, in all pages there must be a div that the id
"container" and contains all elements.

== Tip: Fix for IE

The right div drops down on IE if the font is justify and italic at the same
time. If justify is used, the following fix is needed:

/* Fix IE: the right div drops down if font is justify and italic at the same time */
blockquote {
  font-style: normal;
  padding-left: 10px;
  border-left: 4px solid #B9335D;
}

/* Fix IE: the right div drops down if font is justify and italic at the same time */
em {
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: bolder;
}

== Tip: Fix for Blueprint

/* Fix Blueprint: clear float:left for images */
#container img {
  float: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
